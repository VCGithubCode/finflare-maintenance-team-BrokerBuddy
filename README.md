The colors are: Navy Blue, Sky Blue, Teal, Crimson, Dark Grey,  and Off-White.
These colors are all reflected in the background image.


### Typography

- #### Background
  A background image with stock candles theme was added to the webpage to give a 3D effect and make the heading area look more interactive.
  As users might expect, they want to feel immersed in the trading market atmosphere, so the team opted for a background that is visually appealing and gives the right impression.



- #### Fonts

 - <img src="readme.docs/Roboto.jpg" width="500" alt="image of google fonts">

The chosen fonts for the website were imported using Google Fonts.
  
  After careful consideration, the team decided to use the fonts Roboto, Montserrat, and Sans-serif as a fallback font for the text on screens of all sizes. We believe that these fonts offer a great combination of aesthetic appeal and readability, and will help to enhance the overall user experience.
