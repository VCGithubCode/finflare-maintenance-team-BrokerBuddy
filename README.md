## Design

### Color Scheme

<img src="readme.docs/color.jpg" width="500" alt="image of color palette">

Our color palette has been carefully selected to reflect the professional yet approachable nature of Broker Buddy. Each color has been chosen to ensure accessibility and to enhance the user experience.<br>

Navy Blue (#003366): Symbolizes trust, responsibility, and professionalism. Used predominantly in our logo and headers to convey reliability.<br>

Sky Blue (#8CBFD3): Evokes a sense of clarity and calmness. It's used for accents and to highlight important features within the app.<br>

Off-White (#F8F8F8): Provides a clean, minimalistic background that enhances readability and ensures content stands out.<br>

Teal (#008068): Represents growth and balance. Applied to elements indicating positive trends or actions, like successful transactions.<br>

Crimson (#DB143C): Grabs attention and signals importance. It is used sparingly for alerts and critical action items, such as error messages or urgent notifications.<br>


### Typography

#### Background
  A background image with stock candles theme was added to the webpage to give a 3D effect and make the heading area look more interactive.
  As users might expect, they want to feel immersed in the trading market atmosphere, so the team opted for a background that is visually appealing and gives the right impression.



#### Fonts

After careful consideration, the team decided to use the fonts Roboto, Montserrat, and Sans-serif as a fallback font for the text on screens of all sizes. We believe that these fonts offer a great combination of aesthetic appeal and readability, and will help to enhance the overall user experience. Our typography choices aim to balance readability with personality, ensuring a seamless reading experience across all devices and platforms.

Primary Font: Roboto â€“ A modern sans-serif typeface that is clear and easy to read. Used for body text and data presentation.

Secondary Font: Montserrat â€“ A geometric sans-serif typeface with a contemporary feel. Used for headings and titles to add character to the page layouts.

 Both fonts are available through Google Fonts, ensuring they are easily accessible and web-safe. <br>
